Estimation of Workload
    estimate smaller portions at a time and combine them together

Decision Making
    Progressive - indicate where the decision will need to be made in timeline

"User Stories"
    Card - Conversation - Confirmaton
    Example: As a user, I want to reserve a hotel room
        OR want to be able to see photos of hotels while searching
    Cards may generate a conversation regarding the details behind them
        How to handle special cases/scenarios
    Cards are equivalent to RAIL/Task items (like those in Github)
        Tasks that become too large should be split
        allow tasks to be large at first, and divide them down as they are 
            higher priority
        use labels to categoize tasks
    Conversations can be accumulated in the task item
    Confirmation - acceptance tests - "conditions of satisfaction"
        Unrelated to the testing of the program
        established prior to development

Task design:
    Tasks should be short enough to accurately estimate the time
    1-3 cards per day (~4-8hrs); 16hrs maximum, 2 per sprint for class
