GITHUB
Feature Branching
    main is always deployable, work in a branch
    naming convention: <GitHub-handle>/<short-feature-description>
        push onto branch, not main
        pull requests before pushing onto feature

Tagging
    indication of a special commit (stable versions)
    can do after commit via website

Commands are in slides for github - add to cmd list

after merging with conflict, do git add and commit changes
