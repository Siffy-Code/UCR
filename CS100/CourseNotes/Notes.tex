    \textbf{Chapter 3 details}\\
    Prerequisites to begin working on a project:\\
    (0) - Starts with the Problem Definition (what details are desired)\\
    (a) List of requirements (gathered via user stories)\\
    (b) Architecture of the Problem\\
    

    \textit{CONCEPT}: The earlier a defect occurs in the process and later 
    it is detected, the more costly the problem\\
    \\
    \textbf{UML Usage}\\
    $\rightarrow$ Only class diagrams will be used for project\\
    \indent $\bullet$ Organize class hierarchy\\
    \indent $\bullet$ - sign is private. + sign is public.  \\
    \indent $\bullet$ Generalization relationship - inheritance - triangle to base class  \\
    \indent $\bullet$ Association relationship - aggregation - stored as a variable in another class - solid line  \\
    \indent\indent$\bullet$ Full or empty diamond included for composition versus aggregation \\
    \indent\indent$\bullet$ Composition is most typical; aggregation is different (more like working together)\\
    \indent $\bullet$   \\
    \indent $\bullet$ Object type is not relevant in UML (pointer or not) - only shows up within class card  \\
